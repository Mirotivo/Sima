# Sima
Multiplatform SPICE inspired by BreadboardSim

# Overview
The project is a simulation tool for electronic circuits, implemented in C# programming language. The aim of the project is to allow users to create and simulate complex electronic circuits and analyze their behavior.

The project consists of several components, including a netlist parser, a DC solver, a transient solver, and an interactive user interface. The netlist parser is used to read in the circuit information from a text file or from the user input, and create a data structure that represents the circuit. The DC solver is used to find the initial operating point of the circuit, which is necessary for transient analysis. The transient solver is used to simulate the circuit over time and calculate the voltages and currents of each element at each time step.

The interactive user interface allows the user to interact with the simulation, such as setting up the simulation parameters, selecting the simulation type, and displaying the simulation results. The user interface can be implemented using a graphical user interface (GUI) or a command-line interface (CLI).

The project is implemented using object-oriented programming principles, with each component of the project being represented as a separate class. The classes are designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for easy addition of new components or features in the future. The project is also designed to be portable and platform-independent, allowing it to run on different operating systems and hardware architectures.

Overall, the project provides a powerful tool for electronic circuit design and analysis, allowing users to simulate complex circuits and analyze their behavior with ease.
